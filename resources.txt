Quantum computing- introduction
- Uses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems which are too complex for classical computers.
- Classical computers are made of bits which can hold 0 or 1, whereas quantum computers are made of qubits which can hold value 0 or 1
or a quantum superposition of these states.

- QIO - set of algorithms used for optimization which run on classical hardware but use principles of quantum to increase performance.
    Based on the problem and the data used, quantum computing can-
    Find a solution faster than other optimization techniques for a fixed use case and fixed quality of solution.
    Find a higher quality solution than other optimization techniques for a fixed problem and fixed amount of time.
    Use a more realistic model than other optimization techniques by extending the problem to consider more variables.

- Portfolio optimization - select a subset of most optimal stocks out of a given set of stocks, and find how much should be invested
to make maximum return, with minimum risk. 


- Parallel tempering - It is a quantum inspired optimizer which is used to used to find the lowest free energy state of a system 
  of many interacting particles at low temperature.

[
    If there are 4 states, classical computers need 2 bits to store them as 00,01,10,11 
    Quantum can store any of the 4 states in a single bit as it can store 0,1 and their superpositions.
    This when scaled, gives a significant increase of performance over classical.
