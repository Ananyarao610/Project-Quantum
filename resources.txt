Quantum computing- introduction
- Uses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems which are too complex for classical computers.
- Classical computers are made of bits which can hold 0 or 1, whereas quantum computers are made of qubits which can hold value 0 or 1
or a quantum superposition of these states.

- QIO - set of algorithms used for optimization which run on classical hardware but use principles of quantum to increase performance.
    Based on the problem and the data used, quantum computing can-
    Find a solution faster than other optimization techniques for a fixed use case and fixed quality of solution.
    Find a higher quality solution than other optimization techniques for a fixed problem and fixed amount of time.
    Use a more realistic model than other optimization techniques by extending the problem to consider more variables.

- Portfolio optimization - select a subset of most optimal stocks out of a given set of stocks, and find how much should be invested
to make maximum return, with minimum risk. 


- Parallel tempering - It is a quantum inspired optimizer which is used to used to find the lowest free energy state of a system 
  of many interacting particles at low temperature.

[
    If there are 4 states, classical computers need 2 bits to store them as 00,01,10,11 
    Quantum can store any of the 4 states in a single bit as it can store 0,1 and their superpositions.
    This when scaled, gives a significant increase of performance over classical.

quantum computer harnesses the features of both a particle and a wave, which allows it to explore many different solutions at once, 
which is called “quantum parallelism.”.
Additionally, quantum computers are not affected by noise and can function in extreme conditions, perfect for AI and machine 
learning applications. Another advantage is that quantum computers can overcome errors in traditional computing systems.
Finally, quantum computers can store and process large amounts of data, which is essential for artificial intelligence and 
machine learning models.

"The differences between quantum computers and classical computers are even more vast than those between classical computers 
and pen and paper," Peter Chapman, CEO of quantum startup IonQ, told Insider.
"Because quantum computers process information differently, they are expected to be able to address humanity's greatest challenges."
